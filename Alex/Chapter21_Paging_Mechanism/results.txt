1:
4 runable prozesses and User Cpu time is arround 25% as instances increase,
User CPU time increases because the prozesses doesn't perform a trap by itself.

2:
~1662164KB free -> ~1.6GB free. after allocating 1024MB (1GB) ~611312 (~0.6GB) left.

3:
Total Memory on Container: 2GB
up to ~1900 MB loop time is fast. after getting over 2GB of allocation, looptime is limited in
read/write time of background-storage.

4:
User time gets lower, caused of the I/O's

5: before hitting max size of RAM, the instructions and data fit in Memory. after reaching it,
swaping takes place and slowes down th prozess. of course, the first loop isn't effected, cause it is
pre loaded. if memory is empty, the first loop is slower, cause it isn't cached.

6:
at ~64GB allocation fails
